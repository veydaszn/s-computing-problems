Compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language **before execution** (e.g., C, C++).
- This makes them generally **faster** in execution.
- Errors are caught at compile time.

Interpreted languages translate code **line-by-line at runtime** (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- This makes them easier for **testing/debugging**.
- Slower than compiled languages due to on-the-fly execution.

ðŸ”¹ **Python is an interpreted language**, although internally it compiles code to bytecode before interpretation by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). It is known for readability, flexibility, and suitability for scientific computing.
